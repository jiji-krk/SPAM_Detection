The visualization shows a significant difference in the frequency of specific characters, namely '!' and '$' , between spam and non-spam emails, with a much higher frequency in spam. This suggests that these characters could be important indicators for distinguishing spam.

=> The high frequency of '!' in spam emails is indicative of attempts to grab attention or convey a sense of urgency, two tactics often employed in unwanted emails to prompt recipients to act quickly.

=> The prevalence of the '$' character, marked in spam emails, is consistent with common techniques used in spam to draw attention to potential financial gains or easy money opportunities.

Other characters have relatively similar frequencies between the two categories, suggesting that they may be less discriminatory."""

capital_run_length_average: Non-spam emails tend to have shorter sequences of capital letters on average than spam.

capital_run_length_average_longest: There is a less pronounced difference between spam and non-spam for the longest sequence of capital letters, although spams tend to have longer sequences.

capital_run_length_average_total: The total length of capital letter sequences is significantly higher in spam emails compared to non-spam, suggesting that excessive use of capital letters is a common feature of spams.

This bar plot can be useful for identifying features to use in a spam detection model. It indicates that the use of capital letters is more frequent and intensive in spams than in legitimate emails.
